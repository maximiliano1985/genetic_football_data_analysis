# Genetic-Football-Data-Analysis
A genetic algorithm from the DEAP library is used to train the hyperparameters of the classifier.
The results exhibit a significant improvement on the classifier accuracy thanks to an optimised selection of the model hyperparameters.

# Football-Data-Analysis
This project is divided into two parts. The first part is related to the analysis of data and all the code used for the analysis as well as the final analysis can be found in the Analysis folder. Based on the insights gained from the analysis, a prediction system was built to predict whether a home team will win it's match or not. All the code and the final model relating to the prediction system can be found in the Prediction folder. Also, all the datasets used for the analysis as well as building the model can be found in the Datasets folder.
